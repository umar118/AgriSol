tomato___spider_mites = Spider mites (Tetranychus spp.) can ruin a tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) garden when they colonize the undersides of leaves and suck plant juices. Tiny arachnids, spider mites are in the same family as spiders and ticks and are one of the major pest problems of tomato plants. " Treatment = " Remove leaf litter and other debris from the planting area. Spider mites overwinter in cracks, crevices and protected areas. Spray dusty tomato plants and adjacent areas with water, as spider mite outbreaks often occur in dusty locations. Regular forceful spraying of tomato plants, with care to reach the undersides of leaves, helps prevent spider mites from colonizing on your plants, according to the University of California Statewide Integrated Pest Management Program. Wash tomato plants early in the morning to give the leaves time to dry before nightfall. Irrigate your tomato plants to keep them moist but not wet. Water-stressed tomato plants are more susceptible to spider mite infestations. Avoid the use of chemical insecticides, which kill spider mite predators and can stimulate spider mite reproduction.
tomato___target_Spot = Target spot on tomato fruit is difficult to recognize in the early stages, as the disease resembles several other fungal diseases of tomatoes. However, as diseased tomatoes ripen and turn from green to red, the fruit displays circular spots with concentric, target-like rings and a velvety black, fungal lesion in the center. The “targets” become pitted and larger as the tomato matures. " Treatment = " Remove old plant debris at the end of the growing season; otherwise, the spores will travel from debris to newly planted tomatoes in the following growing season, thus beginning the disease anew. Dispose of the debris properly and don’t place it on your compost pile unless you’re sure your compost gets hot enough to kill the spores.
tomato___yellow_leaf_curl_virus = Tomato Leaf Curl Virus also known as leaf roll affects more than just tomato plants but a whole host of plants. This virus plant disease can be quite deadly for plants and halt the production of fruit altogether – especially if the plants get infected when they are young. Tomato leaf curl virus affects a total of forty-four plant families across 300 species. It is most common in locations with an arid or semi-arid climate. "How can Control it = " Look for disease-resistant varieties to prevent problems with tomato plants.  Plant tomato cultivars less susceptible to yellow leaf virus.  Avoid heavy pruning fo tomatoes.  Mulch to maintain consistent soil moisture. Water as necessary. Given that this virus is spread by silverleaf whiteflies, controlling the spread of the virus has to do mainly with controlling the spread of these insects.
tomato___late_blight = Found on tomato and potato plants, late blight is caused by the fungus Phytophthora infestans and is common throughout the United States. True to its name, the disease occurs later in the growing season with symptoms often not appearing until after blossom. Late blight first appears on the lower, older leaves as water-soaked, gray-green spots. As the disease matures, these spots darken and a white fungal growth forms on the undersides. Eventually the entire plant will become infected. Crops can be severely damaged Unlike other fungal diseases, this plant problem does not overwinter in the soil or on garden trash. Instead the spores are introduced by infected tubers, transplants or seeds. Wind will also carry the disease from nearby gardens. Warm temperatures (70-80˚F) and wet, humid conditions promote its rapid spread. "Treatment = " Plant resistant cultivars when available.  Remove volunteers from the garden prior to planting and space plants far enough apart to allow for plenty of air circulation.  Water in the early morning hours, or use soaker hoses, to give plants time to dry out during the day — avoid overhead irrigation.
tomato___Septoria_Leaf_Spot = Septoria leaf spot is caused by a fungus, Septoria lycopersici. It is one of the most destructive diseases of tomato foliage and is particularly severe in areas where wet, humid weather persists for extended periods.  Septoria leaf spot usually appears on the lower leaves after the first fruit sets. Spots are circular, about 1/16 to 1/4 inch in diameter with dark brown margins and tan to gray centers with small black fruiting structures. Characteristically, there are many spots per leaf. This disease spreads upwards from oldest to youngest growth. If leaf lesions are numerous, the leaves turn slightly yellow, then brown, and then wither. Fruit infection is rare. "Treatment = " Removing infected leaves. Remove infected leaves immediately, and be sure to wash your hands thoroughly before working with uninfected plants. Consider organic fungicide options. Fungicides containing either copper or potassium bicarbonate will help prevent the spreading of the disease. Begin spraying as soon as the first symptoms appear and follow the label directions for continued management. Consider chemical fungicides. While chemical options are not ideal, they may be the only option for controlling advanced infections. One of the least toxic and most effective is chlorothalonil (sold under the names Fungonil and Daconil).
tomato___Bacterial_Spot = The bacterial spot pathogen may produce lesions on all aboveground parts of the plant - leaves, stems, flowers and fruit. It is difficult to reliably distinguish bacterial spot from bacterial speck based on visual symptoms, especially in the early stages. Initial leaf symptoms are small, circular-to-irregular, dark lesions, which may be surrounded by a yellow halo. The lesions tend to concentrate on the leaf edges and tip and may increase in size to a diameter of 3-5 mm. Infected leaves may develop a scorched appearance. When spots are numerous, foliage turns yellow and eventually dies, leading to defoliation of the lower portion of the plant.
tomato___Early_Blight = Symptoms of early blight occur on fruit, stem, and foliage of tomatoes and stem, foliage and tubers of potatoes.  Initial symptoms on leaves appear as small 1-2 mm black or brown lesions and under conducive environmental conditions, the lesions will enlarge and are often surrounded by a yellow halo. Lesions greater than 10 mm in diameter often have dark pigmented concentric rings.  This so-called “bullseye” type lesion is highly characteristic of early blight. As lesions expand and new lesions develop entire leaves may turn chlorotic and dehisce, leading to significant defoliation.  Lesions occurring on stems are often sunken and lens-shaped with a light center and have the typical concentric rings. On young tomato seedlings, lesions may completely girdle the stem, a phase of the disease known as “collar rot,” which may lead to reduced plant vigor or death.
tomato___Mosaic_Virus = Treating mosaic virus is difficult and there are no chemicl controls like there are for fungal diseases. Tomato mosaic virus has been found to survive for up to 50 years in desiccated plant detritus! So tomato mosaic virus control then leans less on eliminating the disease and more on reducing and eliminating the virus sources and insect infestations. Control is mainly based on the use of virus-free seeds.
tomato___Leaf_Mold = Leaf mold is a common fungal disease that affects tomatoes that are cultivated in especially humid environments. Feeding off of the humidity, the mold grows and thrives after attaching itself to the leaves of the tomato plant. Once the mold is noticed, immediate action is required to save the plant, otherwise the foliage will be compromised, which will reduce the amount of tomatoes your plants will yield. Fortunately for tomato growers, this fungal disease is relatively easy to treat and cure. The first signs of leaf mold are, as you might expect, on the leaves themselves, as the topside of the leaves start to develop small gray, yellow, white, or pale green patches. The underside of the leaves begin to develop a fuzzy texture and turn purple. Oftentimes, the fuzz will appear in an olive green color. The fuzzy texture is actually the spores of the mold fungus. The fruit of the tomato plant is rarely infected by leaf mold. Upon noticing the infected areas, the first step is to let the plants air out and dry. If they are being cultivated in a greenhouse, expose them to dry air conditions, because the humidity that the fungus needs to survive and thrive is dried up in the open air.
tomato___Healthy = Your Tomato Plant Leaf Is Healthy.
